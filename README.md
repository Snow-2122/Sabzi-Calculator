## âœ¨ Features

- **Dual Calculation Modes**:
    - **Quantity by Budget**: Determine the amount of an item you can purchase with a specific budget.
    - **Cost by Quantity**: Calculate the total cost for a desired quantity of an item.
- **Quick Select**: Instantly set the reference unit for common items (e.g., 1 kg of potatoes), so you only need to enter the current price.
- **Flexible Units**: Supports both weight (grams, kilograms) and volume (milliliters, liters).
- **Intuitive UI**: A modern, easy-to-use interface designed for quick calculations.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Application

This project is built with React and TypeScript and uses **Vite** as its development server. The previous methods using static servers (like VS Code's Live Server or Python's server) will not work because they cannot process the TypeScript (`.tsx`) files that browsers don't understand.

Follow these steps to set up a proper development environment and run the app on any system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### Prerequisites

1.  **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**: You **must** have Node.js installed. Version 18 or newer is recommended. This installation also includes `npm` (Node Package Manager), which is required to manage project dependencies.
2.  **A Code Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is highly recommended.
3.  **A Terminal**: You can use the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+\`` or `View > Terminal`) or your system's default terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash on Windows).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Open the Project Folder**:
    - Unzip the project files into a folder on your computer.
    - Open this folder in Visual Studio Code (`File > Open Folder...`).

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    - Open the integrated terminal in VS Code.
    - In the terminal, run the following command. This will read the `package.json` file and download all the necessary libraries (like React and Vite) into a `node_modules` folder.
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - This step only needs to be done once.

3.  **Start the Development Server**:
    - After the installation is complete, run this command in the same terminal:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

4.  **View the Application**:
    - The terminal will display a message indicating that the server is running, along with a local URL, typically `http://localhost:5173/`.
    - `Ctrl+click` the link in the terminal, or copy and paste it into your web browser.
    - The application should now be running! The Vite server also provides **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**, meaning any changes you save to the code will instantly update in the browser without needing a full refresh.

### To Stop the Server

- Go back to the terminal window where the server is running and press `Ctrl+C`.

## ðŸ¤– AI Integration Status

**This application, in its current version, does not use any AI features or the Google Gemini API.**

The calculation logic is performed entirely on the client-side using standard mathematical operations. Therefore, **no API key is required** to run or use the app. It is a standalone utility tool.

### Future AI Possibilities

While the current build is not AI-powered, future versions could incorporate Gemini to enhance functionality, such as:
- Fetching real-time market prices for items.
- Providing recipe suggestions based on your shopping list.
- Allowing users to input their requests using natural language.

## ðŸ’» Technology Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript.
- **Vite**: For the local development server and build tooling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling (included via CDN).
