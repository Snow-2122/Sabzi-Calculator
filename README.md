## ðŸš€ How to Run the Application

This is a frontend-only application built with React and TypeScript, served directly from an `index.html` file. You do not need a complex build process to run it.

1.  **Prerequisites**: You need a simple local web server. If you have Python or Node.js installed, you're all set.

2.  **Serve the files**:
    - Open your terminal in the root directory of this project (where `index.html` is located).
    - Choose one of the following commands to start a local server:

    **Using Node.js (with `serve`)**
    If you don't have `serve` installed, run `npm install -g serve` first.
    ```bash
    serve .
    ```

    **Using Python 3**
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

3.  **Access the App**:
    - Open your web browser and navigate to the local address provided by the server (usually `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:5000`, or `http://localhost:8000`).

## ðŸ¤– AI Integration Status

**This application, in its current version, does not use any AI features or the Google Gemini API.**

The calculation logic is performed entirely on the client-side using standard mathematical operations. Therefore, **no API key is required** to run or use the app. It is a standalone utility tool.

### Future AI Possibilities

While the current build is not AI-powered, future versions could incorporate Gemini to enhance functionality, such as:
- Fetching real-time market prices for items.
- Providing recipe suggestions based on your shopping list.
- Allowing users to input their requests using natural language.

## ðŸ’» Technology Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling (included via CDN).
- **esbuild**: The development environment uses esbuild to bundle the code on the fly.
