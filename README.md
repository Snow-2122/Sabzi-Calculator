## ðŸ’» How to Run Locally

This project is built with React and TypeScript and uses **Vite** as its development server. 

Follow these steps to set up a proper development environment and run the app.

### Prerequisites

1.  **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**: You **must** have Node.js installed (version 18 or newer is recommended).
2.  **A Code Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is highly recommended.
3.  **A Terminal**: You can use the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+\``) or your system's default terminal.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Open the Project Folder**:
    - Unzip the project files into a folder on your computer.
    - Open this folder in Visual Studio Code (`File > Open Folder...`).

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    - Open the integrated terminal in VS Code.
    - In the terminal, run the following command. This will download all the necessary libraries into a `node_modules` folder.
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - This step only needs to be done once.

3.  **Start the Development Server**:
    - After the installation is complete, run this command in the same terminal:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

4.  **View the Application**:
    - The terminal will display a local URL, typically `http://localhost:5173/`.
    - `Ctrl+click` the link, or copy and paste it into your web browser.
    - The application should now be running!

### To Stop the Server

- Go back to the terminal window where the server is running and press `Ctrl+C`.
